<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Irregular verbs memorization is a must when you are learning English, and there's no better way to do it than testing yourself with a nice quiz. With the verb in Spanish and a related image you will have to enter Infinitive, Past and Participle. Afterwards you can check the correct answer and the correct pronunciation.
